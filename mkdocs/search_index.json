Requirements: Requirements for deployment\n1.  Project Repository: Contains  information on how the repository is organised.\n2.  Pre-deployment Process: Details how to build the software from the source code and how to build the other project artefacts. Additional information on the various steps of the build process is also provided as well as a list of all required libraries.\n3.  Deployment: How to install and run the software, and the system requirements.\n4.  Post-deployment: Details how to display the final product.  \n\n\n0. Requirements\n\n\nBuild Agent Requirement\n\n\nYour build agent will need to meeting the following minimum requirements. GPU is a must as you will need a valid graphic card and graphic card drive to activate Unity:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents\n\n\nMinimum Requirement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOperating System\n\n\nOS: Windows 7 SP1+, 8, 10, 64-bit versions only; macOS 10.11+. Server versions of Windows & OS X are not tested.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCPU\n\n\nCPU: SSE2 instruction set support.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGPU\n\n\nGPU: Graphics card with DX10 (shader model 4.0) capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAditional Platform Development Requirements\n\n\niOS:\n Mac computer running minimum macOS 10.12.6 and Xcode 9.0 or higher. \nAndroid:\n Android SDK and Java Development Kit (JDK); IL2CPP scripting backend requires Android NDK. \nUniversal Windows Platform:\n Windows 10 (64-bit), Visual Studio 2015 with C++ Tools component or later and Windows 10 SDK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeployment Server Requirement\n\n\nThe deployment server used in developnet is a Linux OS family member - Ubuntu. This section covers the minimum hardware requirements for these deployment servers.\n\n\nUbuntu Desktop Edition\n\nProcessor: 2 GHz dual core processor\nRAM: 2 GiB RAM (system memory)\nStorage: 25 GB of hard-drive space (or USB stick, memory card or external drive but see LiveCD for an alternative approach)\nDisplay: VGA capable of 1024x768 screen resolution (Optional)\nAccessories: \nInternet access\n\nPort Selection: \n* 22/tcp  open ssh\n* 80/tcp  open http\n* 631/tcp open ipp\n* 3306/tcp open mysql\n* 8000/tcp open http-alt\n\n\nUbuntu Server Edition\n\nProcessor: 300 MHz x86 processor\nRAM: 256 MiB of system memory (RAM)\nStorage: 1.5 GB of disk space\nDisplay: Graphics card and monitor capable of 640x480 (Optional)\nAccessories: \nInternet access\n\nPort Selection: \n* 22/tcp  open ssh\n* 80/tcp  open http\n* 631/tcp open ipp\n* 3306/tcp open mysql\n* 8000/tcp open http-alt\n\n\n1.Project Repository\n\n\nThe source code and related artefacts are hosted at Bitbucket server, the entire repository can be cloned through the following command:\n\n\nsudo git clone [https://bitbucket.cis.unimelb.edu.au:8445/scm/swen90013/swen90013-2018-pl](https://bitbucket.cis.unimelb.edu.au:8445/scm/swen90013/swen90013-2018-pl)\n\n\n\n\nAfter having successfully cloned the project, move to the current master branch to verify our latest released version with:\n\n\nsudo git checkout master\n\n\n\n\nThis is equivalent to our latest release branch:\n\n\nsudo git checkout release-sprint3\n\n\n\n\n2.Pre-deployment Process\n\n\nPlanning Visualisation\u2019s presentation layer is based on WebGL and Unity, the contents of which can be generated from the Unity part of the repository. This section covers how and what to generate:\n\n\n2.1 Install Unity Dependencies\n\n\nInstall the Version 2018.2.1f1 from \nhttps://unity3d.com/\n, when installing, select \"Include WebGL\u201d.\n\n\nAdditionally, download the followings for building Unity files (This requires roughly 50MB storage space).\n\n\nsudo apt-get install -y libgconf-2-4\n\n\n\n\nsudo apt install libcanberrra-gtk\\*\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Build Unity Project\n\n\nThe build process is designed to be cross-platform and self-contained. What all this means is that you can run the various build tasks on any machine where a validated Unity is available, without having to worry about resolving other library dependencies.\n\n\nThe Unity project can either be built from the Unity command line, or from the Unity GUI.\n\n\n2.2.1 Building from command line\n\n\nTo build from the command line, enter the following command. We illustrate the idea with Ubuntu build agent. However, the idea can apply to any OS.\n\n\nMove to the \n/PlanningVisualise\n  directory in the repository that you\u2019ve just checked out from Section 1 and from there type, at the command prompt:\n\n\n/home/$USER/Editor/Unity -batchmode -quit -projectPath \u201cProjectPath\u201d -executeMethod buildscript.build -logFile stdout.log\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will need to replace the \u201cProjectPath\u201d with the absolute path of your cloned copy of the repository. E.g. \u201c/home/$USER/swen90013-2018-pl\n/PlanningVisualise\n\u201d\n\n\nYou will need to replace \u201c/home/$USER/Editor/Unity\u201d with the absolute path of Unity executable on your build agent.\n\n\nCompilation progress can be found in \u201cstdout.log\u201d.\n\n\n\n\nFor more information on each of the components in the command, please visit\n\nhttps://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CommandLineArguments.html\n\n\nShould you wish to update the User Interface of this application, you need to include all your customised Unity scenes in the buildscript prior to compilation, buildscript can be found:\n\n\n../swen90013-2018-pl/PlanningVisualise/Assets/Editor/buildscript.cs\n\n\n\n\nWith having the command executed, a folder called \u201cbuildweb\u201d should appear under the \n/PlanningVisualise\n  directory and this will be the final animation contents for the deployment process in Section 3.\n2.1 Install Python3 Dependencies\n\n\nShould you wish to change the server side of the repository, you will need to install the following libraries in order to compile the python files with Python3 Interpreter, Python3 Interpreter can be downloaded with :\n\n\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install python3.6\n\n\n\n\nAddition libraries include:\n\n\nsudo apt-get install python-pip \nsudo pip install numpy scipy**3\\.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Building from Unity GUI\n\n\n\n\nOpen Unity\n\n\nClick File -> Build Settings\n\n\nChoose 'WebGL'\n\n\nMake sure all the selected scenes are those under the 'Visualisation' folder\n\n\nClick 'Player Settings'\n\n\nClick 'Publishing Settings'\n\n\nEnter 512 for 'WebGL Memory Size'\n\n\nTick 'WebAssembly'\n\n\nClick 'Build'\n\n\n\n\nUbuntu Deployment Process\n\n\nInstalling and running Planning Visualisation is very easy: drop the distribution directory somewhere on your filesystem and run your servers! This section details all this more precisely. An obvious set of pre-requisites is Apache server and Django Server.\n\n\n3.1 Apache Web Server Installation\n\n\nFor Ubuntu server, run the following commands to install Apache server:\n\n\n```\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade\n\nsudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-doc apache2-utils\n\n\n\nAfter having successfully installed the Apache server, you can run the server with the following command:\n\n\n\n\nsudo service apache2 start\n\n\n\n**3.1 Apache Web Server Deployment**\n\nWith the command provided in section 2, you should be able to get a folder called \u201cbuildweb\u201d under \u201c../swen90013-2018-pl/PlanningVisualise/\u201d. The remaining is easy: drop the distribution directory to the designated Apache source folder and restart your apache server:\n\n*   Move all the files and subdirectories under \u201cbuildweb\u201d to \u201c/var/www/html/\u201c\n*   Restart the apache server with \n    ```\u201csudo service apache2 restart\u201d```\n\n\n**3.2 Django Server Installation**\n\nFor Ubuntu server, run the following commands to install Django server:\n\n\n\n\nsudo apt install python3-pip\npip3 install djangorestframework\nsudo apt-get install python3-django\nsudo apt-get install gunicorn3\n\n\n\n\n**3.2 Django Server Deployment**\n\n\nOnce the installation is done and the Django server is ready, move to the **_/server_**  directory and from there type, at the command prompt:\n\n\n\n\nsudo gunicorn3 -b 0.0.0.0:8000 server.wsgi \u2014reload\n\n\n\nAfter all, the server should be reachable from external network and your project should be ready.\n\n\n**4. Post-deployment**\n\nPlanning Visualisation can then be accessed within any web browser that is compatible with WebGL by typing the IP address of you deployment server.\n\n**5. Heroku Deployment**\n\n**5.1 Pre-deployment Process**\n\nPlease make sure your setup has met the following conditions:\n\n*   a free [Heroku account](https://signup.heroku.com/signup/dc).\n*   Python version 3.6 installed locally - see the installation guides for [OS X](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/), [Windows](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/win/), and [Linux](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/linux/).\n*   [Pipenv installed](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/) locally. Accomplish this by running pip install pipenv.\n*   [Postgres installed](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql#local-setup) locally, if running the app locally.\n\n\n\n**5.2 Deployment Process**\n\nHeroku Command Line Interface (CLI) - Once installed, you can use the HEROKU command from your command shell. To log in with your Heroku account:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nheroku login\n\n\nEnter your Heroku credentials.\n\n\n\n\n//Email: \nuser@example.com\n\n//Password:\n\n\n\n\nTo clone your project with:\n\n\n\n\ngit clone \nhttps://github.com/heroku/python-getting-started.git\n\ncd python-getting-started\n\n\n\nNext, create an app on Heroku, which prepares Heroku to receive your source code:\n\n\n\n\nheroku create\n\n\n\n\nWhen you create an app, a git remote (called heroku) is also created and associated with your local git repository. Heroku generates a random name (in this case lit-bastion-5032) for your app, or you can pass a parameter to specify your own app name. Now deploy your code:\n\n\n\n\ngit push heroku master\n\n\n\n\nUse a [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile) to explicitly declare what command should be executed to start your app.\n\nThe Procfile in the example app you deployed looks like this:\n\n\n\n\nweb: gunicorn gettingstarted.wsgi --log-file -\n```\nThis declares a single process type, web, and the command needed to run it. The name web is important here. It declares that this process type will be attached to the \nHTTP routing\n stack of Heroku, and receive web traffic when deployed. Procfiles can contain additional process types. For example, you might declare one for a background worker process that processes items off of a queue.\n\n\n5.3 Unity with Heroku Deployment\n\n\nWhen deploying the Django server with Heroku, you will also need to make sure to redirect the traffic for your local server to Heroku within Unity, this can be done by simply enabling and changing the settings in \nScenesCoordinator.cs:\n\n\n\n\nAs shown above in the picture, the current setting is pointing to local machine. Enabling the line below will redirect the data stream to your Heroku server. You should replace \u201c\nhttps://immense-bastion-42146.herokuapp.com/upload/pddl\n\u201d with your Heroku application.",

            "text": "1 Purpose\n\n\nThis document explains the functioning of the Visualisation File Generator (VFG) for the purposes of development. For deployment and the user guide, see README.md.\n\n\nThe VFG decides where objects are on the screen and what they look like.\n\n\nMost domain-related modifications to the system should be made to the VFG. For example, a new domain might require objects to be laid out in a manner which is not captured in the existing Animation Profile language.\nExtending the Visualisation File Generator requires only building the project in Django (see section 2.2 of README.md).\nModifications or extensions of the VFG need only be carried out only on the Django server (not Unity).\n\n\n2 Getting Started\n\n\nTo build the VFG, see README.md\n\n\n3 Overview\n\n\nInput files:\n\n\n\n\nDomain PDDL file\n\n\nProblem PDDL file\n\n\nAnimation Profile\n\n\n\n\nOutput file:\n\n\n\n\nVisualisation file\n\n\n\n\nOverall Architecture:\n\n\n\n\n4 Components\n\n\n4.1 Parser\n\n\n\n\nHere is the code structure of parser. The \nParser component\n gets domain PDDL file, problem PDDL file, animation PDDL file and plan PDDL file and parsers these files into\npredicates list\n and \nanimation profile json\n to feed \nSolver component\n.\n\n\n4.1.1 Plan_generator.py\n\n\nSend domain file and problem file to planning.domain API and gets the solution file.\n\n\ndef get_plan(domain_file, problem_file):  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function will send the domain and problem pddl file to the planning.domain  API to get the plan\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Domain_parser.py\n\n\nTransfer domain file into a list of predicates and record all possible predicates in this domain.\n\n\ndef get_domain_json(file_name): \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function transfers domain file to a list of predicates.\n\n\nRegular expression is used to get the result.\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of the \noutput\n:\n\n\n{\n    \"on\": 2,\n    \"on-table\": 1,\n    \"clear\": 1,\n    \"arm-free\": 0,\n    \"holding\": 1\n}\n\n\n\n\n4.1.3 Problem_parser.py\n\n\nInterprete problem file and get all predicates for INIT and GOAL stages\n\n\ndef get_object_list(predicates_lists,str_init):  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function gets object list of the domain from predicate list\n\n\n\n\ndef get_regex_list(predicates_lists):  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function changes the format of predicate list\n\n\n\n\ndef get_problem_json(file_name, predicates_lists):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function parse the problem PDDL file and get the initial predicates and goal predicates.\n\n\n\n\nHere is an example of the \noutput\n:\n\n\n[{\n    \"init\": [{\n        \"name\": \"on\",\n        \"objectNames\": [\"c\", \"b\"]\n    }, {\n        \"name\": \"on-table\",\n        \"objectNames\": [\"a\"]\n    }, {\n        \"name\": \"on-table\",\n        \"objectNames\": [\"b\"]\n    }, {\n        \"name\": \"on-table\",\n        \"objectNames\": [\"d\"]\n    }, {\n        \"name\": \"clear\",\n        \"objectNames\": [\"a\"]\n    }, {\n        \"name\": \"clear\",\n        \"objectNames\": [\"c\"]\n    }, {\n        \"name\": \"clear\",\n        \"objectNames\": [\"d\"]\n    }, {\n        \"name\": \"arm-free\",\n        \"objectNames\": [\"No objects\"]\n    }]\n}, {\n    \"goal\": [{\n        \"name\": \"on\",\n        \"objectNames\": [\"a\", \"b\"]\n    }, {\n        \"name\": \"on\",\n        \"objectNames\": [\"b\", \"c\"]\n    }, {\n        \"name\": \"on\",\n        \"objectNames\": [\"c\", \"d\"]\n    }],\n    \"goal-condition\": [\"and\"]\n}]\n\n\n\n\n4.1.4 Predicates_generator.py\n\n\nInterpret solution file and get all predicates for every stage in solution file.\n\n\ndef remove_unused_char(action_list):  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function removes all the useless characters from solution file.\n\n\n\n\ndef get_action_name(current_step):  \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function returns the action name of the current step.\n\n\n\n\ndef get_stages(plan, problem_dic, problem_file, predicates_list):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis function gets the predicates for each stage.\n\n\n\n\nOutput of Parser: Predicate List of all stages\n\n\n1. Description\n\n\nThe predicate list is generated by \nParser Component\n and feeds \nSolver Component\n. It includes all the \npredicates for each stage\n and the \nobject list\n for the problem. Using the result of predicate list and animation profile, the solver can apply the one-way constraint solver to calculate the visualisation result. The object list can be used in the initialisation of the solver.\n\n\n2. Format\n\n\nThe format for predicate list and object list is:\n\n\n{\n\"stages\": [{ --stage list\n\"items\": [{ -- predicate list in each stage\n\"name\": , -- predicate rule\n\"objectNames\": -- objects to be referenced\n}],\n\"add\": , -- compared to previous stage, what predicates are added\n\"remove\": , -- compared to previous stage, what predicates are removed\n\"stageName\": , -- name of the stage\n\"stageInfo\": -- stage information\n} ],\n\"objects\": -- object list in the problem\n}\n\n\n\n\n3. Example\n\n\nHere is an example of the predicate list for Blocks domain.\n\n\n{\n\"stages\": [{\n\"items\": [{\n\"name\": \"on\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"c\", \"b\"]\n}, {\n\"name\": \"on-table\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"a\"]\n}, {\n\"name\": \"on-table\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"b\"]\n}, {\n\"name\": \"on-table\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"d\"]\n}, {\n\"name\": \"clear\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"a\"]\n}, {\n\"name\": \"clear\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"c\"]\n}, {\n\"name\": \"clear\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"d\"]\n}, {\n\"name\": \"arm-free\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"No objects\"]\n}],\n\"add\": \"\",\n\"remove\": \"\",\n\"stageName\": \"Initial Stage\",\n\"stageInfo\": \"No Step Information\"\n}, {\n\"items\": [{\n\"name\": \"on-table\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"a\"]\n}, {\n\"name\": \"on-table\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"b\"]\n}, {\n\"name\": \"on-table\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"d\"]\n}, {\n\"name\": \"clear\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"a\"]\n}, {\n\"name\": \"clear\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"d\"]\n}, {\n\"name\": \"clear\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"b\"]\n}, {\n\"name\": \"holding\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"c\"]\n}],\n\"add\": [{\n\"name\": \"clear\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"b\"]\n}, {\n\"name\": \"holding\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"c\"]\n}],\n\"remove\": [{\n\"name\": \"on\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"c\", \"b\"]\n}, {\n\"name\": \"clear\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"c\"]\n}, {\n\"name\": \"arm-free\",\n\"objectNames\": [\"No objects\"]\n}],\n\"stageName\": \"unstack (c b)\",\n\"stageInfo\": \"(:action unstack\\r\\n :parameters (c b)\\r\\n :precondition\\r\\n (and\\r\\n (on c b)\\r\\n (clear c)\\r\\n (arm-free)\\r\\n )\\r\\n :effect\\r\\n (and\\r\\n (holding c)\\r\\n (clear b)\\r\\n (not\\r\\n (clear c)\\r\\n )\\r\\n (not\\r\\n (arm-free)\\r\\n )\\r\\n (not\\r\\n (on c b)\\r\\n )\\r\\n )\\r\\n )\"\n}],\n\"objects\": [\"b\", \"d\", \"c\", \"a\"]\n}\n\n\n\n\n4.2 Solver\n\n\n4.2.1 Overview\n\n\n\n\nHere is the code structure of solver. This module will generate the visualisation file by using the predicates of all stages and animation profile.\n\n\n\n\ncustom_function.py:\n\n\nThis module contain all the customer function we designed to help position the objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ninitialise.py:\n\n\nThis component is used to initialise the environment and objects for Predicate Solver.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrandom_color.py:\n\n\nThis function will provide a randomly selected colour for Initialise to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsolver.py:\n\n\nThis module will compute the visualisation file by using the stages predicates and animation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis module will generate the visualisation file by using the predicates of all stages and animation profile.\n\n\nHere is the algorithm diagram of our constraint solver:\n\n\n\n\nHere is the link for this diagram: \nhttps://www.draw.io/#G12sCLukE55c_9VOKCJZqUiMh7OWFeaAXJ\n\n\nFor instance, here are the predicates that need to be solved:\n\n\n(On-table a)\n(On b a)\n(On c b)\n\n\n\n\nIn the predicates, the object ahead is the object to be solved and the object behind is the predefined object. To calculate the position of \"c\", we must know the position of \"b\". Similarly, to calculate the position of \"b\", we must know the position of \"a\". From (on-table a), we can know the position of a, so \"b\" is solved and then \"c\" is solved. The diagram below shows how the objects are referenced.\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1 Steps\n\n\nThere are 5 main steps in the algorithm of constraint solver:\n\n\n4.2.1.1 Create an Object Table (initialise.py , random_color.py)\n\n\ndef initialise_objects(object_list, animation_profile):  \n\n\n\n\nThis function will initialise objects in the animation profile and use a dictionary to store all the objects and their attributes.\n\n\nIn the dictionary, it will store all objects and their attributes, as shown in the table below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprefab\n\n\nname\n\n\ncolor\n\n\nheight\n\n\nwidth\n\n\ny\n\n\nx\n\n\nshowName\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\na\n\n\nBlock\n\n\na\n\n\n\"a\": 1, \"r\": 0.41, \"b\": 0.41, \"g\": 0.55\n\n\n40\n\n\n80\n\n\nfalse\n\n\nfalse\n\n\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere is a simple example of object dict:\n\n\n\"a\": {\n        \"prefab\": \"Block\", \n        \"name\": \"a\", \n        \"color\": {\n            \"a\": 1, \n            \"r\": 0.41, \n            \"b\": 0.41, \n            \"g\": 0.55\n        }, \n        \"height\": 40, \n        \"width\": 80, \n        \"y\": false, \n        \"x\": false, \n        \"showName\": true\n    }\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1.2 Separate Each Stage (customer_functions.py, solver.py)\n\n\ndef solve_all_stages(stages, objects_dic, predicates_rules, space):  \n\n\n\n\nThis function will seperate each stage in stages list and run through each stage which contains a list of predicates and solve all the predicates.\n\n\nThe stages list is like:\n\n\nStage1: Predicate1, Predicate2, Predicate3,....\nStage2: Predicate1, Predicate3, Predicate3,...\n...\n\n\nHere is a simple example of one stage:\n\n\n{\n    \"items\": [\n        {\n            \"objectNames\": [\n                \"c\"\n            ], \n            \"name\": \"on-table\"\n        }, \n        {\n            \"objectNames\": [\n                \"a\"\n            ], \n            \"name\": \"clear\"\n        }, \n        {\n            \"objectNames\": [\n                \"b\"\n            ], \n            \"name\": \"on-table\"\n        }, \n        {\n            \"objectNames\": [\n                \"c\", \n                \"a\"\n            ], \n            \"name\": \"on\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1.3 Create Predicate Query (customer_functions.py, solver.py)\n\n\ndef solvepredicates(predicates, objects_dic, predicates_rules, space):  \n\n\n\n\nThis function will store all predicates in a query and pop a predicate from predicates list, and try to solve it by calling check_rule_complete and applypredicates function. If it can be solved, then it will be removed from the query, if it can not be solved yet, it will be put back to the predicate list. The function will return true until all predicates are solved.\n\n\nThe predicate lists will be separated like:\n\n\nPredicate1, Predicate2, Predicate3,....\n\n\n\n\nIf predicate1 is solved then the predicate list will remove predicate1 and start to solve predicate 2:\n\n\nPredicate2, Predicate3,....\n\n\n\n\nIf predicate 1 can't be solved, then it will be put back to the query:\n\n\nPredicate2, Predicate3,....Predicate1\n\n\n\n\n4.2.1.4 Check whether predicate can be solved (customer_functions.py, solver.py)\n\n\ndef check_rule_complete(predicate, objects_dic, predicates_rules):  \n\n\n\n\nThis function will check whether this predicate can be solved. \n\n\nFor example, here is a predicate for object a and c:\n\n\n {\n            \"objectNames\": [\n                \"c\", \n                \"a\"\n            ], \n            \"name\": \"on\"\n        }\n\n\n\n\nThe predicate rule is \"on\" and the objects are \"a\" and \"c\". In this predicate, \"a\" is the referenced object, so to define the position of \"c\", we must know the position of \"a\". If a's value has not be defined, the function will return false because this predicate can't be solved for now.\n\n\n4.2.1.4 Apply Animation Rule (customer_functions.py, solver.py)\n\n\ndef applypredicates(predicate,objects_dic,predicates_rules,space):\n\n\n\n\nThis object will update the value of related object in the object list by applying the animation rule.  \n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n(on-table a)\n\n\n\n\nUsing distributex function in the extensions, a's y value is set to 0.\n\n\na.y = 0\n\n\n\n\n4.3 Adaptor\n\n\n\n\nHere is the code structure of adapter. This component transfers the result generated by Predicate Solver into the final visualisation file.\n\n\ndef transfer(one_stage, initialobjects, panel_size,shiftx,shifty, padding=20):\n\n\n\n\nThis function converts the dictionary into the info needed in visualisation file.\n\n\ndef get_panel_size(result, padding=20):\n\n\n\n\nThis function will for loop all the objects in the visualisaiton dictionary, and try to find the max_x and max_y of the panel.\n\n\nFor example, \n\n\n.........max_y\n.        .\n.        .\n.        .\n........max_x\n\n\n\n\ndef generate_visualisation_file(result, object_list,animation_profile):  \n\n\n\n\ndef get_visualisation_json(predicates, animation_profile):\n\n\n\n\nThese functions are the main functions of this module,they will call the other functions to manipulate the visualisation file for the unity visualiser.\n\n\n\"shape\": {\n  \"Block\": {\n    \"prefab\": \"Block\",\n    \"showName\": true,\n    \"x\": false,\n    \"y\": false,\n    \"color\": \"randomcolor\",\n    \"width\": 80,\n    \"height\": 40\n },\n  \"Claw\": {\n    \"prefab\": \"Claw\",\n    \"color\": {\n      \"r\": 0,\n      \"g\": 0,\n      \"b\": 0,\n      \"a\": 1\n },\n    \"showName\": false,\n    \"x\": 230,\n    \"y\": 500,\n    \"width\": 80,\n    \"height\": 40\n },\n\n\n\n\nVisualisation File Structure\n\n\nVisualisation Files are in JSON. \n\n\nThey contain\n* a list of visual stages, containing\n    * a list of visual sprites. \n        * Each Visual sprite has a number of properties, outlined below\n    * Stages also contain a name and a list of predicates true at that stage\n* A table of images (base64) for visualisation\n* Subgoal map and pool, for displaying data about subgoals\n\n\nAn example Visualisation file is shown below.

It is a Unity architecture.\n\n\nModifying the visualiser is only required when the current visualiser cannot adequately render the domain on-screen. It does not concern the logic of object layout. For example, a user might want to extend the Visualiser to support animated sprites.\n\n\nExtending the Visualiser requires building the project in Unity and Django (see section 2.2 of README.md). Modifications or extensions of the Visualiser need only be carried out on Unity (not Django). For information on the Visualiser, see the file 'Visualiser Documentation'.\n\n\n2 Getting started\n\n\n2.1 Installation\n\n\nInstall Unity (See README.md)\n\n\n2.2 Usage\n\n\nSee the User Manual, which is accessible from within the application, or with the file \nUser Manual.html\n.\n\n\n2.3 Development\n\n\nThe visualizer will takes the visualization file generated by the visualization file generator. The visualizer will automatically analyze the visualization file and transfer the JSON data into a few Unity prefabs and display them on the screen.\n\n\n2.3.1 Editing Scenes\n\n\nOpen Planning Visualisation folder as an Unity workspace. Drag scenes file to the Hierarchy to start editing the GameObjects in the scene, Scene files are under the Scene folders\nin the AnimationProfile and Visualier folders.\n\n\n2.3.2 Editing Scripts\n\n\nScript can be created directly in the Assets directories, simply right click Create -> C# Script. If scripts are going to be attached to a game object, the class should be extending\nMonoBehaviour. Unity would recommend using their monoDeveloper to code for the guideword when using Unity.Engine.\n\n\n2.3.3 How to Run\n\n\nPut only the scene you want to test in the Hierarchy and press the play button at the top.\n\n\n2.3.4 Building WebGL\n\n\nAfter Selecting all the scene with the starting Scene being the first one clicked\nThere is a WebGL module that need to be installed, open the installer again and tick only the WebGL module to be installed.\nAfter the module is loaded, in Files -> Build Setting, select WebGL and click Player Setting, the inspector on your right will show the setting of the web player, select the NewTemplate\nas our template, and click Build and Run in the Build Setting window and select the Built file location. This may take a while, after it is finished, the Browser will open the First Scene\nof the project. Later, unless we have a new built, we can go to the directory of the built and open the index.html. Notice that Chrome will not allowed to open html file locally, so better\nto set up a server or using other Browser to open the index.html.\n\n\n3 Architecture Overview\n\n\nInput: a visualisation file. The visualisation file is a generic JSON file generated by the VFG, demonstrating how shapes are to be drawn on the screen in stages. The structure of the Visualisation File is outlined in the VFG Documentation file.\nOutput: a visualisation of the visualisation file\n\n\nArchitectural design:\n\n\n\n\nDirectory Structure\n\n\n\n\n+---Visualiser\n|   +---Animations\n|   +---Fonts\n|   +---Images\n|   +---Resources\n|   +---Scenes\n|   +---Scripts\n|   |   +---FileUpload\n|   |   \\---Visualisation\n|   |       +---AnimationControl\n|   |       +---TransferPack\n|   |       \\---VisualisationModels\n|   \\---Sprites\n\\---WebGLTemplates\n    \\---NewTemplate\n\n\n\n\n\nThe input of the visualizer is the visualization file.\n\n\nThe visualization file is parsed into a local object with the following structure:\n\n\n// Solution - Wraps all stages as a whole solution\npublic class VisualSolutionObject\n{\npublic VisualStageObject[] visualStages;\npublic int transferType;\npublic Dictionary<string, string> imageTable;\npublic int numberOfStages;\npublic Color highlightColor;\n}\n\n// Stage - Contains all sprites in this stage\npublic class VisualStageObject\n{\npublic VisualSpriteObject[] visualSprites;\npublic string stageName;\npublic string stageInfo;\n}\n\n// Sprite - Presents any visual object drawn on the screen\npublic class VisualSpriteObject\n{\npublic string name;\npublic string prefabImage;\npublic Color color;\npublic bool isShowName;\npublic float minX;\npublic float maxX;\npublic float minY;\npublic float maxY;\npublic int rotation;\npublic int depth;\npublic bool isHighlighted;\n}\n\n\n\n\n4 Components\n\n\nComponents are structure via a number of subdirectories to the Visualiser folder\n\n\nAnimations\n\n\nKeeps the files for Unity animations. These files are used to define how prefabs fade-in or fade-out.\nThese files will only be used by the Unity Engine.\n\n\nFonts\n\n\nKeep the files for Unity fonts. These files are used by the Unity engine to correctly display text.\nThese files will only be used by the Unity Engine.\n\n\nImages\n\n\nKeep the file for UI elements of the visualizer. These files are used to display the \"play\" button or \"pause\" button.\nImages of the animations are not kept here.\n\n\nScenes\n\n\nKeep the files of Unity scenes.\n\n\nSprites\n\n\nDefines the basic prefabs (or sprites) of Unity.\n\n\nResources\n\n\nOther resources used by the Unity Engine.\n\n\nScripts\n\n\nC# scripts are kept in this folder. This is what to edit when new features are added to the visualizer.\n\n\nImportant Scripts\n\n\nSpriteController.cs\n\n\nSpriteController is the script controls how a visible object is rendered on the screen.\nThis script will generate prefab according to the data in the visualization file. It will also change the size of the prefab to fit the size of the screen. The liner-movement logic is implemented in this script too.\n\n\nVisualiserController.cs\n\n\nSpriteController is the script manages the solution file and all visual objects in each stage.\nThis script keeps all the GameObject as an objects pool. It is also responsible for rendering each step in the solution.\n\n\n5 Extensions\n\n\nThe visualizer is designed as a component that only displays data in the visualization file.\n\n\nMost extensions to Planning Visualiser can be made through the VFG.\nIf new types of animiations need to be supported which cannot be represented in the existing Visualsiation File format:\n* Define a new object property in the visualization file\n* Modify the scripts SpriteController.cs and VisualiserController.cs to implement the new object properties",

            "text": "1 Introduction\n\n\n1.1 Purpose\n\n\nAn Animation Profile (AP) is a user-written PDDL file which tells the Visualiser how a Domain is to be visualised. Each Animation Profile corresponds to one Domain. \n\n\nEssentially, the AP provides a set of visual objects (\"shapes\") within the domain, along with a set of mappings from Predicates to animation behaviours.\n\n\n1.2 Scope\n\n\nThe AP Language is designed to be flexible enough to allow for the animation of many simple PDDL domains, such as those found at https://bitbucket.org/planning-researchers/classical-domains/src/208a850d2ff2a27068329ad578ad99af9ec7e5c5/classical/?at=master. \n\n\nCurrently, APs have been written for four domains from this repository: Blocks, Towers of Hanoi, Logistics, and Grid.\n\n\nOther simple domains can be visualised in the language. For more complicated domains, additional functions or object properties may be added (See section 4).\n\n\n2 Using the Language\n\n\nThis section contains complete documentation for the syntax and semantics of the AP language. For a quick starting point to writing your own AP, see section 3.\n\n\n2.1 Key Components\n\n\n2.1.1 Predicates\n\n\nThe first content of the AP should be the Predicate blocks. Here is an example of a Predicate block.\n\n\n(:predicate holding\n\n                 :parameters (?x claw)\n                 :effect (\n                 (equal (?x x y) (claw x y))\n                 )\n\n  )\n\n\n\n\nThere should be one or zero Predicate blocks for each Predicate in the Domain. If there is no Predicate block for a Predicate in the domain, the Predicate is ignored by the solver.\n\n\nPredicate Blocks contain:\n* The name of the Predicate, for example \nholding\n.\n* The parameters of the Predicate. Parameters are objects to which the Predicate applies. For example, \nholding(?x)\n means that the predicate on-table is true for the object ?x.\n* The effect of the Predicate. This is a logical statement concerning object properties which holds true when the predicate holds true. For example, \n(equal (?x x y) (claw x y))\n means that the object \n?x\n is at the object \nclaw\n.\n* (Optionally) A Priority:\n    *   Specifies a priority in which predicates are solved\n    *   Example:\n    *   \n:priority 0\n\n    *   Higher priority predicates are applied first\n    *   This is required to ensure a limited number of domains (eg Towers of Hanoi) can be solved. Typically it is required when multiple predicates affect the same variables.\n\n\n2.1.2 Visual\n\n\nvisual defines the objects represented on the screen.\n\n\nAn example of a visual block is:\n\n\n(:visual block\n              :type default\n              :properties(\n                (showname false)\n                (x NULL)\n                (y NULL)\n                (color (function randomcolor)) \n                (width 80)\n                (height 80)\n                (base64image iVBORw0KGg...oAA)\n              )\n  )\n\n\n\n\nvisual blocks contain:\n* The name of the shape, for example \nblock\n\n* The type of the object. Types can either be \ndefault\n, \ncustom\n, or \npredefine\n. \n  * \ndefault\n objects apply to any objects mentioned in the problem file. A 'block' in the problem file is an example of a default object. \n  * \ncustom\n objects are additional to the problem file, and are created by the user for visual effect. The 'claw' is an example of a custom object - it mainly serves a visual purpose and is not specified in the problem or domain file. The robot in the Grid domain is another example of a custom object - it is not explicitly mentioned in the domain objects, but its behaviour is still fairly dynamic (moving around etc)\n  * \npredefine\n These objects are assigned only to domain objects whose name matches any of the names in the :object field. This is used to apply properties to domain objects with specific naming conventions, for example, \nkey1\n, \nkey2\n, ... in the Grid domain. Alternatives, you can use \n%key\n shortcut to represent all the objects start with \"key\".\n* Object properties. These properties govern the position and appearance of the object. See section 2.4 for a detailed list of object properties.\n\n\n2.2 Syntax\n\n\n2.2.1 Description\n\n\nThe syntax of the language is based on PDDL syntax, which is itself based on Lisp. See Section 2.2.2 for detailed resources on these languages.\n\n\n2.2.2 Resources\n\n\n\n\nPDDL information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_Domain_Definition_Language\n\n\nPDDL examples, solver: http://planning.domains/\n\n\nLisp information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)\n\n\nLisp Tutorial: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/lisp/\n\n\n\n\n2.3 Types\n\n\nA type is a class of variable to which a property can be assigned. The use of the word 'type' is therefore fairly loose.\n\n\nAP supports a number of 'types':\n* Integer\n* Boolean - \ntrue\n or \nfalse\n\n* Function - Allocates a property based on some function, for example, \ndistribute_horizontal\n\n* Color - either a colour constant, eg \nBLACK\n, (see below), the \nRANDOMCOLOR\n function (see section 2.5), or an rgb value, for example \n#FAA2B5\n\n* Constant - A number of pre-defined constants exist. These should by convention be written in CAPITALS.\n  * Colours: BLACK, RED, BLUE, GREEN, YELLOW\n  * Integer Constants: PANEL_SIZE\n  * \nNULL\n - A \nNULL\n value means the user is not specifying the property. \nNULL\n properties are typically be set by Predicate rules.\n\n\nA list of the types to which each property can be assigned is in section 2.4.\n\n\n2.4 Object Properties\n\n\nA number of Object Properties can be assigned for each Shape.\n* showname (Boolean): whether to display the shape's name on screen\n* x (Integer): x position of the shape on screen\n* y (Integer): y position of the shape on screen\n* colour (Colour): Colour of the shape. Can be a constant (eg \nBLACK\n), an RGB value (eg \n#FAA2B5\n), or the custom value \nRANDOMCOLOR\n which picks a random RGB value.\n* width (Integer): Width of the object on screen\n* height: Height of the object on screen\n* base64image: A Base64 string representing the shape's image. Base64 images can be generated at https://www.base64decode.org/\n* depth: Depth of the object on screen. Higher depth objects are drawn behind lower depths.\n* label: Optional attribute specifying a string label to be drawn on the object.\n\n\n2.5 Functions\n\n\nFunctions have two uses:\n* In Predicate blocks: here they are 'declarative' in nature and when specified, are true for their parameters\n* In object properties: Here they return a value (eg random_colour).\n\n\nList of functions:\n\n\nDistribution\n\nDistribution functions 'distribute' objects in a certain manner. They are used to lay objects out on the screen. All objects for which the same parameters of 'distribute' are called will be included in the distribution. Distribution works such that objects will be placed in a certain area without overlapping. Between animation frames, objects will not move (unless their positions are reset).\n\n\n\n\ndistributex\n\n\nThis function distributes objects along a horizontal plane. \n\n\nParameter \nspacebtwn\n governs the space between objects\n\n\nExample of use:\n\n\n(assign (?x x) (function distributex (objects ?x) (settings (spacebtwn 40))))\n\n\ndistributey\n\n\nThis function distributes objects along a vertical plane. \n\n\nParameter \nspacebtwn\n governs the space between objects\n\n\nExample of use:\n\n\n(assign (?city y) (function distributey (objects ?city)))\n\n\ndistribute_grid_around_point\n\n\nThis function distributes objects within a grid-like structure \n\n\nParameter \nspacebtwn\n governs the space between objects\n\n\nExample of use:\n\n\n(assign (?p x y) (function distribute_grid_around_point (objects ?p)))\n\n\ndistribute_within_objects_vertical\n\n\nThis function distributes objects vertically within the bounds of another object. For example, cars can be distributed within a city.\n\n\nParameter \nspacebtwn\n governs the space between objects\n\n\nExample of use:\n\n\n(assign (?r x y) (function distribute_within_objects_vertical (objects ?r ?x)(settings (spacebtw 20))))\n\n\ndistribute_within_objects_horizontal\n\n\nThis function distributes objects horizontally within the bounds of another object. For example, cars can be distributed within a city.\n\n\nExample of use:\n\n\n(assign (?obj x) (function distribute_within_objects_horizontal (objects ?obj ?loc)))\n\n\n\n\nOther Functions\n\n* \ncalculate_label\n\n    * \ncalculate_label (objects ?obj1 ?obj2))\n displays a numeric label for obj1, based on the number of obj2 objects with this function applied to them. For example, if there are 3 instances of calculate label for \n(a b) (a c) (a d)\n, then object \na\n will have a label of \"3\". Useful for displaying how many objects are inside another object\n    * Example of use:\n    * \n(assign (?obj2 label) (function calculate_label (objects ?obj1 ?obj2)))\n\n* \nalign_middle\n\n    * \nalign_middle (objects ?x ?y)\n aligns objects x to the middle of  object y\n    * Example of use:\n    * \n(assign (?x x) (function align_middle (objects ?x ?y)))\n\n* \napply_smaller\n\n    * apply_smaller (objects ?x ?y) sets ?y to be displayed smaller than ?x. \n    * the parameter \nincrease_width\n specifies the extend to which an object is wider\n    * Example of us:\n    * \n(assign (?x width) (function apply_smaller (objects ?x ?y) (settings (increase_width 6))))\n\n\n\n\ndraw_line\n\n\nDraws a line between two objects\n\n\nExample of use:\n\n\n(action (function draw_line (objects ?x ?y)))\n\n\n\n\n3 Worked Example\n\n\nThe following example is for the Blocks domain.\nTo see the final result for this AP, see the link in section 1.2 for the associated domain and problem files. These can be visualised with this animation profile.\n\n\nThe following is an example problem visualised with this animation profile:\n\n\n\n\nThe animation profile is as follows (comments  added with a # symbol):\n\n\n(define (animation blocksworld)\n\n  # the 'on' predicate takes two parameters (objects) ?x and ?y\n  (:predicate on\n                 :parameters (?x ?y)\n                 :effect( \n\n\n        # the effect of the `on` predicate is that ?x's x value is equal to ?y's x value, and that ?x's y value is equal to ?y's ?y value plus its height.\n        # that is, object ?x is on top of object ?y\n                 (equal (?x x y) (?y x (sum y height)) \n                 )\n  )\n\n  (:predicate on-table\n\n                 :parameters (?x)\n                 :effect(\n\n\n        # the predicate on-table specifies that the object should be distributed horizontally, with a y value of 0\n        # and a margin of 5\n                 (equal (?x x y) (function distribute_horizontal (margin 5)(y 0))\n                 )\n\n  (:predicate holding\n\n                 :parameters (?x claw)\n                 :effect ( \n                 (equal (?x x y) (claw x y))\n                 )\n\n  )\n\n\n\n  # Below are the list of shapes\n\n\n  (:shape block\n        #block shape is the default shape type. All domain objects have this type by default\n        :type default\n\n\n        # all 'shape' objects have the following properties\n              :properties(\n                (showname false)\n                (x false)\n                (y false)\n\n\n        # randomcolor assigns a random color to the object\n                (color (function randomcolor))\n                (width 80)\n                (height 80)\n\n\n        # this is a base64 string representing the image of the object\n                (base64image iVBORw0KGg...oAA)\n              )\n  )\n\n  (:shape claw\n        #custom object types do not appear in the domain\n        #they are mainly cosmetic. This object represents the claw (the claw does not move)\n              :type custom\n              :properties(\n                (showname false)\n                (x 230)\n                (y 500)\n                (color black)\n                (width 80)\n                (height 40)\n                (base64image iVBORw0KGg...oAA)\n               )\n  )\n  (:shape board\n              :type custom\n              :properties(\n                (showname false)\n                (x 0)\n                (y 0)\n                (color black)\n                (width panel_size)\n                (height 5)\n                (base64image iVBORw0KGg...oAA)\n              )\n  )\n\n)\n\n\n\n\nThree other Animation Profiles are provided in the source code under Test/Sample Files. Each of these is commented for readability.\n\n\n4 Extending the Language\n\n\n4.1 Extension Areas\n\n\nThere are two primary methods of extending the AP language: \n1. Object properties (section 2.4)\n  * This is for simple ways of extending the appearance of objects, eg adding rotation or the font of 'showname'\n2. Adding functions (section 2.5)\n  * This is for more complex ways of describing object behaviours and interactions, eg adding new object layout options\n\n\n4.2 Extension Steps\n\n\n\n\nModify the extensions.py file in the directory to add any functions or properties. See the document 'VFG Documentation.md' for more information.\n\n\nIn limited advanced cases, exta functions may need to be written for Visualiser (Unity)\n\n\nAdd the necessary documentation in this .md file.",

List of functions:  Distribution \nDistribution functions 'distribute' objects in a certain manner. They are used to lay objects out on the screen. All objects for which the same parameters of 'distribute' are called will be included in the distribution. Distribution works such that objects will be placed in a certain area without overlapping. Between animation frames, objects will not move (unless their positions are reset).   distributex  This function distributes objects along a horizontal plane.   Parameter  spacebtwn  governs the space between objects  Example of use:  (assign (?x x) (function distributex (objects ?x) (settings (spacebtwn 40))))  distributey  This function distributes objects along a vertical plane.   Parameter  spacebtwn  governs the space between objects  Example of use:  (assign (?city y) (function distributey (objects ?city)))  distribute_grid_around_point  This function distributes objects within a grid-like structure   Parameter  spacebtwn  governs the space between objects  Example of use:  (assign (?p x y) (function distribute_grid_around_point (objects ?p)))  distribute_within_objects_vertical  This function distributes objects vertically within the bounds of another object. For example, cars can be distributed within a city.  Parameter  spacebtwn  governs the space between objects  Example of use:  (assign (?r x y) (function distribute_within_objects_vertical (objects ?r ?x)(settings (spacebtw 20))))  distribute_within_objects_horizontal  This function distributes objects horizontally within the bounds of another object. For example, cars can be distributed within a city.  Example of use:  (assign (?obj x) (function distribute_within_objects_horizontal (objects ?obj ?loc)))   Other Functions \n*  calculate_label \n    *  calculate_label (objects ?obj1 ?obj2))  displays a numeric label for obj1, based on the number of obj2 objects with this function applied to them. For example, if there are 3 instances of calculate label for  (a b) (a c) (a d) , then object  a  will have a label of \"3\". Useful for displaying how many objects are inside another object\n    * Example of use:\n    *  (assign (?obj2 label) (function calculate_label (objects ?obj1 ?obj2))) \n*  align_middle \n    *  align_middle (objects ?x ?y)  aligns objects x to the middle of  object y\n    * Example of use:\n    *  (assign (?x x) (function align_middle (objects ?x ?y))) \n*  apply_smaller \n    * apply_smaller (objects ?x ?y) sets ?y to be displayed smaller than ?x. \n    * the parameter  increase_width  specifies the extend to which an object is wider\n    * Example of us:\n    *  (assign (?x width) (function apply_smaller (objects ?x ?y) (settings (increase_width 6))))   draw_line  Draws a line between two objects  Example of use:  (action (function draw_line (objects ?x ?y)))",

            "text": "Planning Visualisation - User Guide\n\n\n1. Overview\n\n\nThis document contains the User Guide for Planning Visualiser.\n\n\nThe Planning Visualiser is an open-source program which visualises\nsolutions to Planning Problems. It is an executable Unity architecture\nin a browser.\n\n\n1.1 Planning Problems\n\n\nFor information about Planning Problems, see \nhttp://planning.domains/\n\n\nOur application uses one \u2018Animation Profile\u2019 per problem domain. An\nAnimation Profile is a user-written PDDL file which tells the Visualiser\nhow a Domain is to be visualised. See the developer docs for more\ninformation.\n\n\n1.2 Scope\n\n\nPlanning Visualiser currently has Animation Profiles for four problem\ndomains; Blocks, Grid, Towers of Hanoi, and Logistics. Other simple\nproblem domains may be added by writing an Animation Profile (see\nsection 3.2).\n\n\nPlanning visualiser can generate a solution using the solver on\n\nhttp://planning.domains/\n . Alternatively, the user can provide their\nown solution from any solver, provided it conforms to the correct\nformat.\n\n\n2. Using the system\n\n\n2.1 Visualise Built-in Domains\n\n\n2.1.1 Select Files\n\n\nFrom the home screen, two options are available:\n\n\nBuild visualisation from Problem\n\n\n\n\nChoose this option to generate a visualisation for a given problem\n\n\nRequires the following files: Domain PDDL, Problem PDDL, Animation\n    Profile PPDL. \nFiles for existing domains are located in the\n    bitbucket repository under Test/Sample Files.\n\n\nA custom URL can be chosen to connect to any solver. The default is\n    solver.planning.domains\n\n\n\n\nBuild visualisation from Solution VFG\n\n\n\n\nChoose this option to view the visualisation for an existing\n    Visalisation file\n\n\nReuqires the following file: Visualisation File\n\n\nThis allows the user to generate a visualisation file once, and\n    watch it multile times or share it with others\n\n\n\n\nOnce the correct files are uplodaded, the user will be taken to the\nVisualiser screen.\n\n\n2.1.2 Visualise Solution\n\n\nThe visualisation page has several parts.\n\n\n\n\nSteps Panel:\n Shows all the steps in the solution. Steps can be\n    clicked to navigate the animation to that step.\n\n\nStep Information Panel:\n shows detailed information for each\n    step, including actions.\n\n\nAnimation Panel:\n displays the animation. Objects in the domain\n    are darkened when they are part of a satisfied subgoal.\n\n\nControl Panel:\n buttons to control the animation. These include\n    changing the speed of the animation, Play/Pause, Step\n    Forward/Backwards, Replay\n\n\nSubgoal panel:\n Shows all subgoals (predicates which comprise the\n    goal state). Subgoals change colour when they are satisfied.\n    Clicking on the subgoal opens a dropdown list to all of the steps in\n    which the subgoal is satisfied.\n\n\nHeader Bar:\n Contains Home button, Help button, and a button to\n    download the Visualisation file. This downloaded visualisation file\n    can be shared with others or re-watched.\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Visualise a new Domain\n\n\nThis can be done, for many simple domains, with no modification to the\nsystem.\n\n\nTo add a new domain:\n\n\n\n\nWrite or obtain a Domain PDDL file for the problem domain.

The below recommendations are one way of recording the\nanimation, however many other methods and tools exist to achieve this.\n\n\n2.3.1 MacOS Users\n\n\nTo video record the visualisation, have the animation you wish to record\non your screen, then complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nLaunch the pre-installed QuickTime Player application\n\n\nSelect \u201cFile\u201d and choose \u201cNew Screen Recording\u201d\n\n\nTo decide whether mouse clicks and sounds appear in your recording\n    or not, click the small, white arrow and select the appropriate\n    options from the drop-down menu.\n\n\nWhen ready, click the red record button.\n\n\nYou will need to select what you want to record. To record the\n    entire screen, click once anywhere. To record only a portion of it,\n    click and drag a box and then click \u201cStart Recording.\u201d\n\n\nWhen finished, navigate to the menu bar and click the stop recording\n    button designated by the square symbol.\n\n\nTo save your recording, click \u201cFile\u201d and then\"Save\", and choose an\n    appropriate save location and name for the recording.\n\n\n\n\nView and share file as you would with any other media file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions adapted from\n    \nhttps://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-record-your-computer-screen/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 Windows Users\n\n\nTo video record the visualisation, have the animation you wish to record\non your screen, then complete the following steps:\n\n\n\n\nPress the Windows key and the letter G at the same time to open the\n    Game Bar dialog (this will pop up on your screen).\n\n\nCheck the \u201cYes, this is a game\u201d checkbox to load the Game Bar. This\n    is the procedure regardless of what you are recording.\n\n\nClick on the Start Recording button, or press Win + Alt + R to start\n    screen recording.\n\n\nStop the recording by clicking on the red recording button on the\n    pop-up.\n\n\nThe video can be accessed via your Videos folder, inside the\n    Captures folder.\n\n\n\n\nInstructions adapted from\n\nhttps://www.laptopmag.com/articles/how-to-video-screen-capture-windows-10\n\n\n3. Extending the system\n\n\nPlanning Visualiser is modular and can be extended in multiple ways.\n\n\nMany simple domains can be captured in the existing Animation Profile\nlanguage.
